spongeABC and plotimage functions in crewes are used for absorbing boudary condition and plot images. 

# figure 1--------------------------
figure 1a-f can be run directly to reproduce figure 1a-1f.

# figure 2--------------------------
Run figure2_M1_1D.m, figure2_M1_1D_38.m. And then run figure2_ab_compare_plot_2.m,  figure 2 a and b are obtained; 

Run figure2_M3_BalancedABS_1D.m, figure2_M3_BalancedABS_1D_r38.m, figure2_M3_Non_BalancedABS_1D.m, figure2_M3_Non_BalancedABS_1D_r38.m. And then run
figure2_cd_compare_plot_2.m, figure 2 c,d are obtained; 

Run figure2_M4_BalancedABS_1D.m, figure2_M4_BalancedABS_1D_r38.m,figure2_M4_Non_BalancedABS_1D_r19.m, figure2_M4_Non_BalancedABS_1D_r38.m. And then run
figure2_ef_compare_plot, figure 2 e,f  are obtained. 

# figure 4(figure 3 is velocity model, figure 4 is comparsion of seismograms)--------------------------
Run figure3_Tra.m, figure3b.m, figure3c.m,figure3d.m,figure3e.m, figure3f.m. And then run figure3CompareResult.m, figure 3 is obtained.

# figure 6(figure 5 is velocity model, figure 6 is comparsion of seismograms)--------------------------
Run figure5a.m,figure5b.m,figure5c.m,figure5d.m,figure5e.m,figure5f.m. And then run figure5plot.m, figure 6 is obtained.
